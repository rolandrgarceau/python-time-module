# [PySimpleGui](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and WxPython

I have used wxPython before. It was prior to a DR event, so I will need to refer back to the documentation to make sure this gets installed properly on my mac.

## From the [docs](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

... Run your program in the System Tray using WxPython. Or, change the import and run it on Qt with no other changes.
